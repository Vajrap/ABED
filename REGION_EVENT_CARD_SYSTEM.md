# Region Event Card System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ System Complete

The Region Event Card system has been successfully implemented and integrated with the game loop.

## 📊 Design Decision: ONE SHARED DECK

After careful analysis, we chose **one shared deck** over separate regional decks:

### The Math
- **8 draws per year** (twice per season × 4 seasons)
- Average scale per card: ~12 (weighted deck composition)
- **~96 scale increase per year**
- Global scale max: **250**
- **Reaches climax in 2-3 years** (probabilistic, not guaranteed)

### Why Not Multiple Decks?
If we had 8 separate decks (one per region):
- 8 regions × 8 draws each = **64 draws/year**
- Would hit 250 scale in ~4 months
- Too predictable, too fast
- Less interesting cross-region interactions

### Why Not Subregion Cards?
If we had weekly subregion cards:
- 36 subregions × 52 weeks = **1,872 draws/year**
- Even with scale 0-2, would max out in 2-3 months
- Completely unmanageable

## 🎴 Card Structure

Each Region Event Card has:

1. **globalEventScale** (0-30): How much it increases the global scale
2. **targetRegions**: Which regions are affected (`RegionEnum[]` or `"all"`)
3. **onDraw()**: Effect function that returns `NewsEmittedFromLocationStructure | null`
4. **description**: Story text for the event

### Scale Distribution

| Value | Type | Frequency | Purpose |
|-------|------|-----------|---------|
| 0 | Peaceful | 30% | Slow/reset escalation |
| 10 | Minor | 30% | Steady progression |
| 20 | Moderate | 30% | Notable escalation |
| 30 | Major | 10% | Significant events |

```

## 🔄 Game Loop Integration

The system is integrated at the **monthly** milestone:

```typescript
// GameLoop.ts - Line 120
if ((dayOfSeason === 1 || dayOfSeason === 25) && hour === 1) {
  // New Month - Draw Region Event Card
  const regionCardNews = drawRegionEventCard();
  
  if (regionCardNews) {
    allNews = mergeNewsStructures(allNews, regionCardNews);
  }
}
```

This triggers:
1. **Twice per season** (day 1 and day 25)
2. **8 times per year** total
3. **Updates global event scale** automatically
4. **Generates news** for affected regions

## 🎮 Game State Updates

`GameState` now tracks:

```typescript
class GameState {
  // Existing
  globalEventCardDeck: GlobalEventCard[];
  activeGlobalEventCards: GlobalEventCard | undefined;
  
  // NEW: Region Event Cards
  regionEventCardDeck: RegionEventCard[];
  completedRegionEventCards: RegionEventCard[];
  globalEventScale: number; // 0-250
}
```

### Key Methods

**`drawRegionCard()`**:
1. Checks if deck is empty (reshuffle if needed)
2. Draws a card from the deck
3. Adds card to completed pile
4. **Updates global event scale** (capped at 250)
5. Executes card's `onDraw()` effect
6. Returns news structure or null

## 📈 Progression Example

### Year 1
- **Start:** Scale 0
- **8 region cards drawn** (twice per season)
- **Possible outcomes:**
  - All peaceful cards: +0 scale
  - Balanced mix: ~+96 scale
  - All major conflicts: +240 scale (hits cap!)

### Year 2
- **Start:** ~96 scale (from Year 1 average)
- **8 more cards**
- **Likely:** Hits 200-250 scale
- **Climax approaching**

### Year 3
- **Scale at 250 (cap)**
- **Global Event Climax triggers**
- Epic world-changing event unfolds

## 🎯 Example Cards

### 1. Quiet Season (Scale: 0)
```typescript
targetRegions: "all"
effect: World news - "The lands enjoy peace and calm"
```

### 2. Merchant Caravan (Scale: 10)
```typescript
targetRegions: [CentralPlain, SouthernShore]
effect: Regional news for affected regions
```

### 3. Bandit Raids (Scale: 20)
```typescript
targetRegions: [EasternFrontier, WesternForest]
effect: World + regional news about danger
```

### 4. Regional Conflict (Scale: 30)
```typescript
targetRegions: [NorthernReach, BorealFrost]
effect: Major world event - war between regions
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Easy Additions
1. **More cards**: Add to `definitions/` folder
2. **New categories**: Economic, magical, environmental
3. **Dynamic targets**: Cards that choose random regions
4. **Conditional effects**: Based on current global scale
5. **Player involvement**: Special quests triggered by cards

### Advanced Features
1. **Card chains**: Events that trigger follow-up cards
2. **Regional modifiers**: Persistent effects on regions
3. **Scale thresholds**: Different effects at different scales
4. **Card rarity**: Some cards rarer than others
5. **Seasonal themes**: Different cards for different seasons

## 🧪 Testing

To test the system:

```typescript
// In your test file
import { gameState } from "../Game/GameState";

// Test single draw
const news = gameState.drawRegionCard();
console.log(`Current scale: ${gameState.globalEventScale}`);

// Test multiple draws
for (let i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
  gameState.drawRegionCard();
}
console.log(`After 8 draws: ${gameState.globalEventScale}`);

// Test deck reshuffling
for (let i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
  gameState.drawRegionCard(); // Should reshuffle automatically
}

// Test scale cap
gameState.globalEventScale = 245;
gameState.drawRegionCard(); // Should cap at 250
```

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Balanced Escalation
- Not too fast (boring, predictable)
- Not too slow (no tension)
- Probabilistic (uncertainty creates drama)

### Regional Variety
- Cards can affect specific regions or all regions
- Creates localized stories within global narrative
- Players in different regions have different experiences

### Global Coherence
- All cards contribute to one global narrative
- Scale tracks world tension toward climax
- Regional events feed into global story

### Player Agency
- Events create opportunities for player response
- Some cards might spawn quests or challenges
- Players can influence outcomes through gameplay

## ✨ Summary
