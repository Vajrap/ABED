# Market Pricing System - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Built

A complete dynamic market pricing system following your design doc specifications.

## Files Created

1. **`Server/src/Entity/Market/types.ts`**
   - ResourceType definition
   - Production baselines structure (3-level: Global, SubRegion, Location)
   - Transaction tracking types

2. **`Server/src/Entity/Market/PriceModifiers.ts`**
   - `factor()` - Comfort band logic (0.8-1.2 stable, clamped 0.6-1.6)
   - `calculateYearlyBaseModifier()` - Global production vs baseline
   - `calculateLocalShortageFactor()` - 75% local + 25% subregion weighting
   - `monthsUntilNextProduction()` - Calculates months until resource produces again

3. **`Server/src/Entity/Market/ResourceProductionTracker.ts`**
   - Tracks production at Location/SubRegion/Global levels
   - Records production when resources are generated
   - Calculates yearly modifiers
   - Auto-generates baselines from location capacities

4. **`Server/src/Entity/Market/Market.ts`**
   - `getPrice(item, location)` - Main pricing method
   - `getResourcePrice(resource, location, basePrice)` - Resource pricing
   - `adjustYearlyPrices()` - Updates yearly modifiers
   - `setEventModifier()` / `clearEventModifier()` - Event-based price changes
   - `recordTransaction()` - Track buy/sell volumes
   - Singleton instance: `market`

5. **`Server/src/Entity/Market/README.md`** - System documentation
6. **`Server/src/Entity/Market/EXAMPLES.md`** - Usage examples

## Files Modified

1. **`Server/src/Entity/Item/Item.ts`**
   - Added `primaryResource?: ResourceType` field
   - Items can now link to resources for dynamic pricing

2. **`Server/src/Entity/Location/Location.ts`**
   - `generateResources()` now returns amount generated
   - `refillResources()` returns `Map<string, number>` of all generated resources

3. **`Server/src/Entity/Location/Manager/LocationManager.ts`**
   - `refillResources()` now reports production to market tracker

4. **`Server/src/Game/GameLoop.ts`**
   - Line 101-103: Calls `market.adjustYearlyPrices()` on new year
   - Line 113-114: Calls `market.adjustSeasonalPrices()` on new season

5. **`Server/src/Entity/Item/Subclass/ItemCost.ts`**
   - Fixed: Changed `Season` import to `SeasonEnum` (bug fix)

## How It Works

### Price Formula

```
Final Price = Base Price × Yearly Modifier × Local Shortage × Event Modifier
```

### 3-Level Modifiers

1. **Yearly (Global)** - Sticky modifier based on last year's total production
2. **Local Shortage** - Dynamic based on current storage vs months until next production
3. **Event** - Temporary modifiers from global events

### Production Flow

```
New Season → Location.refillResources()
  ↓
Generates resources (e.g., 100 fish)
  ↓
Returns Map { "fish": 100 }
  ↓
LocationManager reports to market.resourceTracker
  ↓
Tracked at 3 levels: Location, SubRegion, Global
```

### Price Adjustment Flow

```
New Year
  ↓
market.adjustYearlyPrices()
  ↓
Calculates globalProduction / globalBaseline for each resource
  ↓
Applies factor() with comfort band
  ↓
Stores yearly modifiers (0.6-1.6 range)
  ↓
Resets tracking for new year
```

## Integration Status

✅ **Complete**:
- Resource production tracking
- Price calculation with all modifiers
- GameLoop integration (yearly/seasonal)
- Transaction recording
- Event modifier hooks

⏳ **Not Yet Implemented** (ready for future):
- Actual buy/sell transactions
- Item creation with primaryResource set
- Demand-based pricing adjustments
- Market UI/API endpoints

## Testing

All existing tests pass:
- ✅ 23 Location.refillResources() tests pass
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Type safety maintained

## Usage

```typescript
// Get an item's price at a location
const price = market.getPrice(ironSword, LocationsEnum.FyonarCity);

// Get a resource's price
const orePrice = market.getResourcePrice("ore", LocationsEnum.FyonarCity, 10);

// Set event modifier (e.g., from Global Event Card)
market.setEventModifier("grain", 1.5); // Great Famine +50%

// Record player transaction
market.recordTransaction(location, "ironSword", 1, true); // bought
```

## Key Design Features

1. **Resource ≠ Item**:
   - Resources: Generic numbers (15 ore, 20 wood)
   - Items: Specific objects (Iron Ore, Oak Plank, Iron Sword)

2. **Auto-calculated Baselines**:
   - Based on location RGC capacities
   - No manual baseline entry needed

3. **Comfort Band** (0.8-1.2):
   - Small production variations don't cause price swings
   - Keeps economy stable

4. **Weighted Local/SubRegion**:
   - 75% local storage matters most
   - 25% subregion provides regional context

5. **Time-aware Shortage**:
   - Storage evaluated against months until next production
   - End of season = higher scarcity pressure

## Next Steps

When ready to use:

1. Set `primaryResource` on your item definitions
2. Test price stability with normal production
3. Trigger shortages and verify price increases work correctly
4. Integrate with trading/shop systems
5. Add event modifiers to your Global Event Cards
