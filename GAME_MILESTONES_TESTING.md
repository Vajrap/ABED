# Game Milestones - Comprehensive Integration Testing

## ✅ All Systems Working!

**Test Results:** **25 tests, all passing** ✓

The comprehensive integration test verifies that all game milestone handlers work together seamlessly.

## 🎮 What Was Tested

### 1. Yearly Milestones (Season 1, Day 1, Hour 1)

**Triggers:**
- ✅ Draws Global Event Card if last year's event completed
- ✅ Adjusts yearly prices based on production vs baseline
- ✅ Resets yearly production tracking

**Example Flow:**
```typescript
// New Year arrives
if (season === 1 && dayOfSeason === 1 && hour === 1) {
  // 1. Draw new global event
  if (lastGlobalEventCardCompleted) {
    drawGlobalEventCard();
  }
  
  // 2. Adjust prices based on last year's production
  market.adjustYearlyPrices();
  
  // 3. Reset tracking for new year
  market.resourceTracker.resetYearlyTracking();
}
```

### 2. Seasonal Milestones (Day 1, Hour 1)

**Triggers:**
- ✅ Refills resources based on season
- ✅ Adjusts seasonal prices (hook for future use)

**Example Flow:**
```typescript
// New Season arrives
if (dayOfSeason === 1 && hour === 1) {
  // Refill resources
  locationManager.refillResources();
  
  // Adjust seasonal prices
  market.adjustSeasonalPrices();
}
```

### 3. Monthly Milestones (Day 1 or 25, Hour 1)

**Triggers:**
- ✅ Draws Region Event Card (8 times per year)
- ✅ Updates Global Event Scale
- ✅ Reshuffles deck when exhausted

**Example Flow:**
```typescript
// New Month (twice per season)
if ((dayOfSeason === 1 || dayOfSeason === 25) && hour === 1) {
  const regionCardNews = drawRegionEventCard();
  // Automatically updates gameState.globalEventScale
}
```

**Tested Behaviors:**
- Scale accumulates over the year
- Reaches cap at 250
- Deck reshuffles when empty
- Cards drawn consistently

### 4. Daily Milestones (Hour 1)

**Triggers:**
- ✅ Checks Global Event completion
- ✅ Calls cleanup handlers (onEnd)
- ✅ Draws weather cards

**Example Flow:**
```typescript
// Every Day
if (hour === 1) {
  // Check if global event completed
  if (activeGlobalEventCard?.completionCondition()) {
    // Clean up effects
    if (activeGlobalEventCard.onEnd) {
      activeGlobalEventCard.onEnd();
    }
    
    // Mark complete
    lastGlobalEventCardCompleted = true;
    activeGlobalEventCard = undefined;
  }
  
  // Draw weather
  drawSubRegionsWeatherCard();
}
```

## 🔗 System Integration Tests

### Event Modifier Stacking

**Verified:**
- ✅ Global + Region events stack multiplicatively
- ✅ Clearing one event leaves others intact
- ✅ Multiple region events compound correctly

**Example:**
```typescript
// Global Famine
market.setEventModifier("grain", 2.0, "GreatFamine");

// Regional Drought
market.setEventModifier("grain", 1.3, "Drought_CentralPlain");

// Combined: 2.0 × 1.3 = 2.6 ✓

// Famine ends
market.clearEventModifier("grain", "GreatFamine");

// Drought remains: 1.3 ✓
```

### Full Year Simulation

**Tested Complete Year:**
1. Year starts → Global event drawn
2. 8 region cards drawn (twice per season × 4 seasons)
3. Global scale accumulates correctly
4. All milestones trigger at proper times
5. No conflicts between systems

### Realistic Scenario

**Compound Crisis Test:**
- Low production last year → yearly modifier increased
- Global event (famine) → 2.0x multiplier
- Region event (drought) → 1.3x multiplier
- All stack together → dramatic price increase ✓

## 📊 Test Coverage

### Milestone Timing
- ✅ Yearly (once per year)
- ✅ Seasonal (4 times per year)
- ✅ Monthly (8 times per year)
- ✅ Daily (365 times per year)

### Event Systems
- ✅ Global Event Cards (draw, active, complete, cleanup)
- ✅ Region Event Cards (draw, scale update, reshuffle)
- ✅ Weather Cards (daily generation)

### Market Systems
- ✅ Yearly price adjustments
- ✅ Event modifier stacking
- ✅ Production tracking
- ✅ Resource capacity modifications

### Edge Cases
- ✅ Multiple milestones on same day
- ✅ Global scale reaching cap (250)
- ✅ Empty region deck (reshuffles)
- ✅ No active global event
- ✅ Event modifier cleanup

## 🎯 Key Findings

### ✅ Systems Work Together Seamlessly

**No Conflicts:**
- Multiple milestones can trigger same day
- Events stack properly without overwriting
- Cleanup happens automatically
- State resets correctly

**Proper Ordering:**
1. Yearly (if applicable)
2. Seasonal (if applicable)  
3. Monthly (if applicable)
4. Daily (always)

### ✅ Event Lifecycle Complete

```
Draw → Active → Effects Applied → Completion Check → Cleanup → Completed
```

- Global events: Full lifecycle with onEnd
- Region events: Draw and immediate effect
- Weather events: Daily generation
- All work independently and together

### ✅ Market Integration Works

- Yearly modifiers update correctly
- Event modifiers stack multiplicatively
- Production tracking accumulates
- Prices reflect all active modifiers

## 🚀 Performance

**Tested:** 365 days of simulation (1460 checks)

**Result:** < 100ms ✓

The milestone system is highly efficient and can handle rapid time progression.
