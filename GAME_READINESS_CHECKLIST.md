## ⚠️ Critical for Basic Gameplay

### 1. API Endpoints - Character Actions
**Status:** ✅ Fully implemented

**Current Implementation:**
- [✅] Character action sequence endpoint (`/api/actions/update`) - Players set their CharacterActionSequence (CAS) for rest, train, craft, etc.
- [✅] Location actions are handled via CAS - all location actions (Rest, Train, Craft, etc.) are set through the action sequence

**Note:** 
- **Battles are automatic** - They occur when parties encounter each other during game loop processing (`GameLoop.processEvents` → `locationManager.processEncounters`). No player-initiated battle endpoint needed (though BattleSimulatorService exists in playground for testing).
- **Skills are automatic** - During battle, skills are selected automatically from the character's skill deck via `getPlayableSkill()`. No manual skill selection endpoint needed.
- **Item management** - Equipment functions exist (`equip`, `removeEquipment` in `Server/src/Utils/equip.ts`) but **no API endpoints exist** for players to manage inventory/equipment. May need endpoints for:
  - Equip item from inventory
  - Unequip item to inventory
  - View inventory
  - Use consumable items (if applicable)

### 2. Battle Rewards & Looting
**Status:** TODO marked in code

**Location:** `Server/src/Entity/Battle/Battle.ts` lines 281, 491

**Needed:**
- [✅] Experience rewards calculation
- [✅] Item drop system

### 3. Character Progression
**Status:** ✅ Fully implemented

**Implementation:**
- [✅] Level up logic (exp thresholds) - `statTracker` system with threshold `5 + level * 2`
- [✅] Stat increases on level up - Two systems:
  - `statTracker.ts`: Grants 1 random stat (attribute/artisan/proficiency < 20) on level up
  - `train.ts`: Rolls D20 for each stat category, nat 20 = +1 to that stat
- [✅] Vital increases on level up - `addBaseVitals()` increases HP/MP/SP
- [✅] Level cap - 30 (hardcoded in `statTracker.ts`)
- [✅] Stat tracking - `gainStatTracker()` called from training actions (attribute, proficiency, artisan, skill)

**Location:** 
- `Server/src/Entity/Location/Events/handlers/train/statTracker.ts` - Main level up system
- `Server/src/Entity/Character/Subclass/Stats/train.ts` - Alternative level up with crit rolls

### 4. Authentication & Session
**Status:** Basic implementation exists

**Needed:**
- [ ] Password hashing (bcrypt) - TODO in `login/index.ts`
- [ ] Session management
- [ ] JWT token system (if using)
- [ ] User authentication middleware

- [ ] Unequip item endpoint (use existing `removeEquipment` function)
- [ ] Get inventory endpoint (expose character inventory/equipment data)
- [ ] Use consumable item endpoint (if consumables are implemented)

### 8. Item Shop System
**Status:** Market exists, but no buy/sell interface

**Needed:**
- [ ] Shop inventory management
- [ ] Buy item endpoint
- [ ] Sell item endpoint
- [ ] Shop refresh logic

### MOBs
- [ ] Active skills for all humanoid classes (~50+ TODOs)
- [ ] Conditional skills (HP/MP low, enemy/ally conditions)

## 📋 Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Checklist

To get the game running for basic gameplay:

### Essential:
1. ✅ Server starts and connects to database
2. ✅ Character creation works
3. ✅ Battle system works
4. ⚠️ **API endpoints for player actions** (partially done)
5. ⚠️ **Battle rewards** (TODO)
6. ⚠️ **Character progression** (level up, exp)
7. ⚠️ **Authentication** (password hashing needed)

### Important:
8. ✅ **Location actions** (fully implemented via `/api/actions/update` - rest, train, craft work; gathering actions need handlers)
9. ⚠️ **Item management** (equip/remove functions exist, but may need API endpoints for inventory management)
10. ⚠️ **Party management** (create, join, leave - need to verify endpoints exist)

### Nice to Have:
11. Quest system
12. Dialogue system
13. Gathering/refining
14. Shop system

### Priority 3: Polish
8. **Quest system** - Content
9. **Dialogue system** - NPC interactions
10. **MOB skills** - Better enemy AI

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Battle rewards** - Fully implemented (exp, items, drop system)
2. ✅ **Level up logic** - Fully implemented (statTracker system with stat increases)
3. **Verify/add item management endpoints** - Check if equip/unequip/inventory endpoints exist
4. **Fix password hashing** - Security issue (TODO in `login/index.ts`)
5. **Test end-to-end flow** - Character creation → Set actions → Game loop processes → Battle (automatic) → Rewards → Level up

**Note on Game Mechanics:**
- **Battles are automatic** - Occur when parties encounter during game loop processing. No player-initiated battle needed.
- **Skills are automatic** - Selected from character's skill deck during battle turns. No manual skill selection.
- **Location actions** - Fully implemented via `/api/actions/update` endpoint where players set their CharacterActionSequence.

The game has a solid foundation! The main gaps are battle rewards and character progression systems.
